\section{Conceptual Solutions}

We combined the generated concept fragments using a \gls{morph} to form whole concepts.
Each team member selected a set of concept fragments from the \gls{morph} and drew their interpretation of the whole concept; this process was done twice to ensure a variety of ideas.
We decided that the concepts generated were adequately creative for our purposes.
Time spent generating a greater variety of ideas would be better used for prototyping. Some of our most creative and promising solutions are presented below\footnotemark.

\footnotetext{The entire list of concepts generated can be found in Appendix B: Concepts Generated.}


\subsection{Creative Concepts}

One of the most creative ideas we generated is The Very Hungry Caterpillar (TVHC, Figure \ref{fig:tvhc}).
TVHC has multiple carts following behind it to allow for better turning capability; furthermore, it has a \gls{pot} in front to detect turns and communicate them to the \gls{arduino}.
This segmented design primarily addresses our train’s need to corner effectively while the need to generate \gls{torque} is reflected in the design’s more traditional gear transmission.

\end{figure}

We created Tanky Train (Figure \ref{fig:tankytrain}) as another alternative design.
Tanky Train uses treads to drive both sets of wheels and increase friction.
The design uses direct drive to transmit \gls{torque} to the treads.
This addresses our design objective of generating a high \gls{torque} to climb the hills on the tracks.
It also uses a \gls{pot} to detect turns and a \gls{drumbrake} to decelerate.

\subsection{Promising Concepts}

Our most promising concept is Get Hitched (Figure \ref{fig:gethitched}).
This design drives each \gls{axle} with a separate motor to increase \gls{torque}.
Get Hitched is also designed to be low to the ground, increasing its cornering ability; this is further increased by the design’s use of \gls{conical}.
A \gls{photores} is used for detecting its position along the track.
This design addresses both of the attributes needed to complete the rounds and achieve our design objectives.

\end{figure}

The concept Puff (Figure \ref{fig:puff}) uses a variable \gls{gearbox} to transfer the energy from the motor to the wheels.
This addresses our primary design objective of increasing \gls{torque} output, while also providing the ability to increase acceleration.
It uses a \gls{pot} to detect turns and \gls{conical} to increase stability during turns.
The design is promising because it has the ability to be easily modified for different rounds.

We also generated many promising designs such as Simplicity (Figure \ref{fig:simplicity}) that uses a \gls{pulleydrive}.
It does not include a turn detection device and uses simple wheels with rubber o-rings.
Despite poorly addressing our cornering objective, the design was simple and we were almost certain it would be built by competition.
It could also be easily modified to include complex parts once a basic prototype was created.
