\maketitle

Please find enclosed our formal report, titled “Mech 223 Rail-Rider Competition: Electric Train Prototype Recommendation”.
The report discusses the process our team underwent to develop a prototype for the Rail-Rider Competition; it describes our steps: strategy, concept generation, and concept evaluation.
It also makes a final recommendation based on the performance of all the teams in the competition.

Our team worked effectively in producing the final prototype as well as completing the report.
The report is limited by the time restrictions imposed on this project.
As a result of this, the depth is somewhat restricted; however, sufficient justification for our assertions is available in the appendices. 

We would like to thank the MECH 226 and 223 instructors for their organization of this competition; additionally, their ongoing support is appreciated. 

If there are any comments or concerns you wish to voice to us, please contact our team leader, Adrian Lam, at (604) 440-8725.
